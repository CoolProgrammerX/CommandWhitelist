# CommandWhitelist
A simple CraftBukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin that I wrote for fun. This plugin allows you to hide existing commands from your server and only allow players to execute the ones you allow them to use. Can be useful if you don't want to blacklist/hide every single command from players (e.g. /pl, /plugins, and stupid aliases). Feel free to modify/edit the code and make your own version.
