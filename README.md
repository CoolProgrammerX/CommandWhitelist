# CommandWhitelist
A simple CraftBukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin that I wrote for fun.

This plugin allows you to hide existing commands from your server and only allow players to execute the ones you allow them to use.
This plugin will get the "Unknown Command" message in spigot.yml and send that message if a command is not whitelisted.
Can be useful if you don't want to blacklist/hide every single command from players (e.g. /pl, /plugins, and stupid aliases).

Also, please note that I typed out this plugin in 15 minutes, and I've not yet tested it.
Code quality might be bad, so I will make updates to this very soon.
Feel free to modify/edit the code and make your own version.
